    <h3>EXPERIENCES</h3>
    <p >
      Two years after graduating from Columbia, Obama moved from New York to Chicago when
      he was hired as director of the Developing Communities Project, a church-based community organization
      originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Roseland, West Pullman, and Riverdale on Chicago's South Side.
      He worked there as a community organizer from June 1985 to May 1988.[52][102] He helped set up a job training program,
      a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in Altgeld Gardens.
      Obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the Gamaliel Foundation,
      a community organizing institute.[104] In mid-1988,
      he traveled for the first time in Europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in Kenya,
      where he met many of his paternal relatives for the first time.[105][106]
